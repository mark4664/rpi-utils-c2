# Script name: c2.py
# check and update ip address display, based on chupip.py

# Added logging and try - except loop around the ftp operation.
# 15 sec timeout added to ftp command.
# Added variable 'build' and send it with other data.
# 
#
# 
# This script requires the 'dig' command which is part of the
# dnsutils package. To check if this is installed type dig into
# the command line.  If the response is '# bash: dig: command not found'
# then run the following command to install it: sudo apt-get install dnsutils
#
# IMPORTANT: this file, together with the configuration
# file c2.json, should be placed in a directory .ipdisclose
# in the user's home directory.
# To create the .ipdisclose directory use the following command;
# mkdir .ipdisclose  NOTE the '.' makes this a hidden directory
#
# The script is intended to be invoked by the cron daemon on startup
# use @reboot with a suitable delay to ensure network connections are in place;
# for example '@reboot sleep 30 && /home/<your user name>/.ipdisclose/c2.py'
# use command crontab -e to edit the crontab file.
#
# The c2.py file must be executable by changing its properties
# see command chmod
